Project 2 - Password Generator

Version 1.0

This is my completed working version of the password generator.
It has 2 php files, index.php and password.php. Index.php is
where the user can input their options for the generator, and
password.php is the actual generator, which takes the options,
generates a password, and writes the password to a Session variable
which index.php can then read and echo to the user.

ChangeLog
*Added dictionary file and file to array parser
*Added Main CSS file
*Added Comic
*Moved isnumber right below password output
*Added bootstrap class names
