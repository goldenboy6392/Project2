Project 2 - Password Generator

Version 0.5

This is my first working version of the password generator.
It has 2 php files, index.php and password.php. Index.php is
where the user can input their options for the generator, and
password.php is the actual generator, which takes the options,
generates a password, and writes the password to a Session variable
which index.php can then read and echo to the user.

To-Do: 
* Write CSS for the page
* Finish debuging
* Use external dictionary/word scraper
